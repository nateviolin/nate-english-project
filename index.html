    <p>Welcome to the map of my year! This map is organized based off the chromatic scale, the most common musical scale in Western music. The scale contains twelve equally-spaced tones:</p>

    </audio>
    <p>
      When any of the twelve tones is played against the resolving tone of the scale (in this case a "C"), one of twelve possible intervals is formed. Each interval has a distinct feeling attached to it, though the interpretation of these feelings may differ slightly depending on the listener. The twelve sites that I chose to portray in my map each correspond to one of the twelve musical intervals on the basis of the emotion that it evokes in me.
