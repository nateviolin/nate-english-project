This experience of reminiscing as my time in Italy came to a close made me assign a greater value to living in the present while keeping in mind the future. By doing this, one can ensure that the memories which their current actions generate will one day be associated not with regret but with appreciation for various lessons learned and connections formed.",

The gardens in which we first met our host families fulfill a similar role in that we, as incoming SYA students, were seeking comfort in a culture different than the one from which we had departed.

This sense of confusion is comparable to that of my first day walking home alone from SYA, when I completely lost my bearings while standing in Piazza delle Erbe, forcing me to use Viterbese locals as my sole resource for navigating the town. Because of this incident, I gained confidence in my language abilities early on in the year and continued to thrive in situations that would have otherwise presented a language barrier.",
